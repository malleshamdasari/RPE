\subsection{Summary}
Enterprise network administrators need QoE information to model QoS to QoE relationship and to efficiently provision their resources. Currently, applications do not provide QoE ground-truth. In this work, we address this problem for video telephony by introducing four scalable, no-reference QoE metrics that capture spatial and temporal artefacts of video quality. We investigate the performance of our metrics over three popular applications -- Skype, FaceTime and Hangouts -- across diverse video content and five mobile devices. Finally, we map our metrics with a large-scale MOS user-study and show a median accuracy of 90\% in annotating the QoE labels according to MOS. Our metrics outperform state-of-the-art work while capturing exact user rating. We plan to extend this study to video streaming, such as YouTube and Netflix, and VR/AR applications.
