    Mobile Internet applications have become predominant with the prolific increase in smartphone usage. 
    Typically, these applications are Web browsing and video applications such as streaming and interactive telephony. 
    The problem here is that the applications are influenced by a number of factors such as the network parameters, hardware performance and the inherent application complexity. 
    This makes it hard in pinpointing and diagnosing the problem which brings new challenges in providing a good quality of experience (QoE) for these applications.
    To this end, we first improve the QoE of these applications by effective utilization of network resources at the client side.
    Then, we dig deep into the effect of underlying device performance to understand device side bottlenecks while providing unlimited network resources.
